 Firewall Bypass Techniques
Nmap offers several techniques to evade firewall detection and bypass filtering mechanisms. Here are the most effective methods:
Stealthy Scanning Methods
-sS (SYN Scan): The half-open scan we discussed - doesn't complete TCP handshake
Verbose Output (-v / -vv)
The verbose flag provides detailed real-time information about the scan progress.
nmap -v target.com
 What Verbose Mode Shows:
Scan progress updates in real-time

Completed port percentages

Discovered ports as they're found

Host discovery details (ping results, ARP requests)

Timing information

Additional warnings and notes
 Version Detection (-sV)
Version detection probes open ports to determine exactly what service/application is running, including version numbers.

How Version Detection Works:
Service fingerprinting: Sends specific probes to open ports

Response analysis: Compares responses to Nmap's database

Pattern matching: Matches against thousands of service signatures

Version reporting: Provides service name and version number
Output Interpretation
When combining these techniques, you get powerful reconnaissance:

Firewall bypass gets you past defenses

Verbose mode shows you exactly what's happening

Version detection tells you what's actually running

This combination allows you to:

Discover hidden services

Identify specific software versions

Find potential vulnerabilities

Understand network architecture

Plan targeted attacks or defenses
